# Lead Capture API

A backend API built with **Python and FastAPI** to capture, validate, persist, and classify potential clients using an LLM.

This project is part of my **Road to Agentic AI**, focused on learning the backend foundations required to build reliable AI-powered systems and automation.

The project evolved from a simple SQLite API into a containerized, tested, authenticated, PostgreSQL-backed API with migrations and public deployment.

## API Endpoints

All endpoints require an API key through the `X-API-Key` header.

| Method  | Endpoint      | Description                   |
| ------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `POST`  | `/leads`      | Create and classify a lead    |
| `GET`   | `/leads`      | Get a paginated list of leads |
| `GET`   | `/leads/{id}` | Get a specific lead           |
| `PATCH` | `/leads/{id}` | Manually update a lead        |

### `POST /leads`

Creates a lead and attempts to classify it with an LLM.

Required fields:

```json
{
  "name": "Juan",
  "email": "juan@example.com",
  "phone": "8095551234",
  "request": "Website design",
  "notes": ""
}
```

Possible classification:

```text
Hot
Cold
pending
```

If the LLM fails, the lead is still stored with `pending` status.

### `GET /leads`

Returns leads using pagination:

```text
GET /leads?page=1&limit=10
```

### `GET /leads/{id}`

Returns a specific lead.

Returns `404 Not Found` if the lead does not exist.

### `PATCH /leads/{id}`

Allows manual updates to a lead, including changing its temperature when its previous classification is `pending`.

---

## Authentication

API key authentication was added to all four endpoints.

```http
X-API-Key: your_api_key
```

Responses:

* `401 Unauthorized` — API key missing
* `403 Forbidden` — invalid API key

The key is stored through environment variables.

---

## Database & Migrations

The project was migrated from **SQLite to PostgreSQL**.

Database sessions are managed through FastAPI dependency injection using:

```python
Depends(get_db)
```

instead of manually creating sessions inside each endpoint.

**Alembic** is used for version-controlled database schema migrations.

A separate migration script is also included under:

```text
migrations/
```

to support transferring existing SQLite data to PostgreSQL.

---

## Error Handling

The API handles failures at different stages:

| Scenario              | Response                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Missing API key       | `401 Unauthorized`          |
| Invalid API key       | `403 Forbidden`             |
| Invalid/missing data  | `422 Unprocessable Entity`  |
| Duplicate email/phone | `409 Conflict`              |
| Lead not found        | `404 Not Found`             |
| LLM failure           | Lead preserved as `pending` |

Database failures use `rollback()` to keep the session consistent.

---

## Logging

`print()` statements were replaced with structured Python logging.

The application uses:

```text
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
```

for application events, warnings, and unexpected failures.

---

## Testing

Automated testing was implemented with **Pytest**.

Tested scenarios include:

* Successful lead creation — `201`
* Duplicate email/phone — `409`
* Invalid data — `422`
* Missing API key — `401`
* Invalid API key — `403`

---

## Docker

The application is containerized with:

```text
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
.env.example
```

Docker Compose runs:

```text
API
PostgreSQL
```

The PostgreSQL service includes a **health check**, ensuring the database is ready before the API starts.

The entire application can be started with:

```bash
docker compose up
```

or rebuilt with:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

No additional manual startup steps are required.

---

## Deployment

The API is publicly deployed using **Render**.

## Project Goal

The long-term goal is to understand the backend foundations behind **AI agents and automation systems**.

```text
Receive information
        ↓
Understand it
        ↓
Make a decision
        ↓
Call external systems
        ↓
Perform an action
        ↓
Store the result
        ↓
Continue the workflow
```

This API is one of the first steps in my **Road to Agentic AI**.
